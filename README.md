This cheat sheet includes some simple ways to create a survival curve, heatmap, and volcano plot.
All those plots are useful for visualization and statistical analysis in Bioinformatics.
Many amazing R packages are available to make those plots in one line.
I try to avoid using those in this cheat sheet so that readers can understand how the data are processed and how those plots are constructed.
